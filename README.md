# Deep-Fake-Detection
An AI-driven system that detects deepfake images by analyzing facial regions, extracting key features, and classifying them as real or fake.
This project focuses on detecting deepfake images using deep learning and machine learning techniques. The model analyzes facial photos and classifies them as either real or fake based on learned visual patterns. A dataset of 10,000 labeled images (real and fake) was used for training and validation.
